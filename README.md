The instructions on how to use the datas for the google collab:

To use all of the datas one would have to decompresse each file in the repository,
except the last one that is so big, but one could access the file in the link below that is shared:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dOxJLcM9FKTbuV-9K0ttK00irN5Qeqxt/view?usp=sharing

And to use it in Google COllab one would need to upload all the files that were downloaded
from the github repository.
